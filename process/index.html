    <h2>Discovery</h2>
    <p>
      We'll work with you to understand why your product or service makes a difference to you or your customers. Our 3-Step Product Roadmap is a process specially designed to engage you and your stakeholders in a short amount of time which produces a solid framework for developing a product. The end result is a refined product vision, conceptual wireframe and rough plan to build a release version.

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>
      Once a 3-Step Product Roadmap is complete, we'll begin an agile process of designing the end result web application from a user perspective. Our goal is to reach an 80% solution within a few iterations.  We want you to show potential customers and get product validation.

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>
      We transition quickly from design to application development. Our architects and developers will recommend and implement an appropriate technology stack depending on the interface design and roadmap.  This is the stage when we turn your static click-through design demo into a fully functioning and production ready web application.

    <h2>Delivery</h2>
    <p>
      We take great pride in our work and build products intended for hand-off to other developers.  At the end of our contract we'll either transition the code base to your internal team or be at the ready for future iterations as you wish depending on your stage of product lifecycle.
