  <h3>Discovery</h3>
  <p>
    We'll work with you to understand why your product or service makes a difference to you or your customers. Our 3-Step Product Roadmap is a process specially designed to engage you and your stakeholders in a short amount of time which produces a solid framework for developing a product. The end result is a conceptual wireframe, feature list and rough plan to build the first version.

  <h3>Design</h3>
  <p>
    Once the 3-Step Product Roadmap is complete, we'll begin an agile process of designing the end result web application from a user perspective. Our goal is to reach an 80% solution within one or two weeks, and then let you validate the user experience.

  <h3>Development</h3>
  <p>
    When the design is "good enough for now", we'll transition to application development. This is the stage in which we turn the static design into a functioning and production ready web application.

  <h3>Delivery</h3>
  <p>
    We'll help you deploy and/or transition code base to an internal team for post version one releases. After launch, we'll coach you on methods to effectively manage and develop for ongoing iterations to retain and acquire customers.
