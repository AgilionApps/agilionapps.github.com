<!--       When the Burlington smart grid program installs digital meters in 2012, Agilion Apps will gather data from the Meter Data Management System (MDMS), without sensitive consumer information, in order for stakeholders to study how self guided consumer behavior improves overall energy efficiency. We love working with the Smart Grid and are looking forward to the smart meter installations!-->

    <p>
      We took first place in the 2012 Vermont Hackathon with a
      web-based market analysis tool called "The Vermont Business Landscape",
      designed to help potential business owners understand the health of various
      business sectors in Vermont.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team believes in the value of small businesses to Vermontâ€™s economy, and
      we discovered that the state has a need for aggregating
      business data from disparate data sources. The Burlington Community &amp;
      Economic Development Office (CEDO) receives frequent inquiries from
      prospective new business owners as to the health of various sectors
      throughout Vermont. By finding real people who had a problem, we were able to
      validate our idea and demonstrate the value of modernizing Vermont's business
      in 24 hours.

        Adam and the <em>Agilion Apps</em> team continued to exceed expectations; delivering innovation, high quality, and quick results. Early on Agilion integrated with our organization taking the time to fully understand our business model and value proposition prior to development. They then were able to flawlessly translate that understanding into a clean, intuitive, and industry leading webapp.
