  <h2>Vermont Hackathon</h2>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/250x250&text=Screen" alt="">
  <p>
  The Agilion Apps team took first place in the 2012 Vermont Hackathon with a
  web-based market analysis tool called "The Vermont Business Landscape",
  designed to help potential business owners understand the health of various
  business sectors in Vermont.
  </p>
  <p>
  Our team believes in the value of small businesses to Vermontâ€™s economy, and
  in doing research, we discovered that the state has a need for aggregating
  business data from disparate data sources. The Burlington Community &amp;
  Economic Development Office (CEDO) receives frequent inquiries from
  prospective new business owners as to the health of various sectors
  throughout Vermont. By finding real people who had a problem, we were able to
  validate our idea and build confidence going into the competition.
  </p>
  <p>
  In order to develop a working prototype in 24 hours, we spent time planning
  up front, and focused on building a minimum viable product that would
  demonstrate the value of modernizing Vermont's business data.

        Adam and the <em>Agilion Apps</em> team continued to exceed expectations; delivering innovation, high quality, and quick results. Early on Agilion integrated with our organization taking the time to fully understand our business model and value proposition prior to development. They then were able to flawlessly translate that understanding into a clean, intuitive, and industry leading webapp.
